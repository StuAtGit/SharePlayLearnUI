- MQTT page for sending messages
- Decide what to do about api endpoint in conf.js (for tomcat on server, empty is fine)
- Link to non-image items (either have a request without encoding, or decode - only previews are requested encoded by default)
- Figure out install - I had to make jsjws a file, not a link to get it to work
- item.name in api, so unknown items can at least have a name

#How I currently deployed
- upload API
- clone UI repo in ROOT folder in tomcat
- bower install depedencies
- rename jsjws folder
- this is not how I want to do it - I just wanted to get the code up.
